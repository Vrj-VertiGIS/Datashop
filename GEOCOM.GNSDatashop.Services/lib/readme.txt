Comments about the Winista.MimeDetect.dll (22.12.2010 erm)
----------------------------------------------------------

Winista.MimeDetect.dll is a small open source library to detect the mime type of a file depending on the extension and/or the file content.
The possible mime-types are defined in an xml file (mime-types.xml).
mime-types.xml needs to be located in the root directory to be able to debug.

This library was built from the original source files but signed with our key to get a strong named assembly.
